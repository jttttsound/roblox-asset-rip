## please note!
Some assets will not work if they're private! Be sure to double check if they're up or not.
BUNDLE ID's ARE NOT SUPPORTED! If you are downloading a bundle, find the normal ID for the bundle.

# how to use
1: Download the exe

2: If the exe is renamed to something else be sure to name it "rblx-rip.exe"

3: Create a folder called "RBLX-RIP"

4: Put the exe inside of the folder

5: In the folder create another folder called "assets"

6: You should be able to run the program now. Happy ripping.
